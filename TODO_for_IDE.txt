    - suggests need for 'session' object to store all running and variables
 - base console root on current directory
 - run via drop down

 - 5/4 give option to delete, create and move files within open directory
 - 3/4 file explorer could just be a module with functions

 - 1/2 backspace four times if there are four spaces (tab)
 - 2/2 dont open a new instance from FE if already open (focus instead)
 - 2/3 modify tab display and tab input options
 - 2/3 auto complete uses keyboard input
 - 4/3 compile on save
 - 4/4 run commands need to work outside keen edit directory
 - 4/4 switch what gets ran (file_name not updating in commands)
 - 4/4 pylint and compile commands not working on opened file explorers
 - 5/3 improve open file logic
 - 4/2 syntax highlight in real time
 - 1/3 make syntax highlight optional for editing text files etc
 - 2/1 why are so many attributes outside init
 - 2/4 line numbers
 - 2/2 'are you sure' before closing or creating new with unsaved changes
 - 3/3 break up menus etc into differnt modules so that notepad can shrink
 - 2/4 jump to correct view after save isn't working


Completed:
 - font size options
 - font choice options
 - ctrl + s, ctrl + o save and open
 - syntax highlightning using pygment from button press
 - tab as four spaces ;)
 - open last open file when re-oening
	- restore workspace
 - open multiple windows
 - better coloring for syntax highlight
 - add open console to view menu
	- involves adding view menu
 - text doesn't wrap
 - file explorer that opens in current directory
 - file explorer functionality
 - color theme should use dictionary for colors, too many attributes
 - open folder option that allows a directory to be open
	- (kind of)
 - 'predictive' typing if you press shift-tab 
    - pop up menu of possible options
 - view jumps on syntax highlight
 - subprocess for calling commands to not lock up window
 - change title of pages opened after first
 - automatic syntax highlighting on save
 - file_path needs to be an instance variable for commands like compile, run
	- resolve self.file vs self.file_name
 - on syntax highlight move to same part of screen
