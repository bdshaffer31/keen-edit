TODO for IDE development:
 - Pylint python code
 - multiple tabs to switch between
 - terminal stays within tkinter
	- or at least is resized reasonably
 - terminal is closed when editor is closed
 - git integration via cmder
 - interpretor for unicode characters?
 - saved / unsaved changes tracker at top of editor
 - automatic syntax highlighting
 - auto indent
 - control z undo, control y redo 
 - add icon
 - change color theme from menu
 - change theme of root/menu based on selected color theme
 - scroll bars dont show when not needed
 - issues changing directories
 - run file from file explorer without hierarchy and freezing
 - syntax highlight based on file extension
 - color code file explorer by theme (needs to not be owned by notepad)
    - suggests need for 'session' object to store all running and variables
 - base console root on current directory
 - run via drop down
 - not show files that can't be opened
 - give option to delete, create and move files within open directory
 - file explorer could just be a module with functions
 - file explorer not opening some times
 - on syntax highlight move to same part of screen
 - backspace four times if there are four spaces (tab)
 - dont open a new instance from FE if already open (focus instead)
 - modify tab display and tab input options
 - auto complete uses keyboard input
 - compile on save
 - file_path needs to be an instance variable for commands like compile, run
	- resolve self.file vs self.file_name
 - run commands need to work outside keen edit directory
 - switch what gets ran (file_name not updating in commands)


Completed:
 - font size options
 - font choice options
 - ctrl + s, ctrl + o save and open
 - syntax highlightning using pygment from button press
 - tab as four spaces ;)
 - open last open file when re-oening
	- restore workspace
 - open multiple windows
 - better coloring for syntax highlight
 - add open console to view menu
	- involves adding view menu
 - text doesn't wrap
 - file explorer that opens in current directory
 - file explorer functionality
 - color theme should use dictionary for colors, too many attributes
 - open folder option that allows a directory to be open
	- (kind of)
 - 'predictive' typing if you press shift-tab 
    - pop up menu of possible options
 - view jumps on syntax highlight
 - subprocess for calling commands to not lock up window
 - change title of pages opened after first
